# Stocks-Analysis

## Overview of the project
We have been trying to create a series code that would put the stocks' numbers together for Steve. Now, he would like to gain more information for the entire stock market, which requires us to design a code that works well with an expanded dataset. Previously, we used the nested loops to generate the total daily trading volumes and yearly return for different stocks based on different years (2017 and 2018). However, when working with a large dataset, the time elasped for running the code becomes significant. Therefore, the purpose of this project is improve the efficiency of the program by refactoring the code we developed earlier.

## Results
